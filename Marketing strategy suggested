# CREDIT-CARD-SEGMENTATION

Cluster 3
This group is performing best among all as customers are maintaining good credit score and paying
dues on time. Not necessarily target these customers as they are using their credit cards on all kind
of transaction, to keep them at this same level of transactions these customer bases can be
rewarded or can be pursued to buy higher limit credit cards.

Cluster 2
They are potential target customers who are paying dues and doing purchases and maintaining
comparatively good credit score ) This group should be maintained by increasing credit limit or can
lower down interest rate -- Can be given premium card /loyalty cards to increase transactions.

Cluster 1
They have poor credit score and taking only cash on advance. This group should be targeted by
sending online credit card transaction offers monthly for electronic or grocery shopping, especially
on major online platforms like amazon and on money transaction apps like paytm, phonepe etc.

Cluster 0
This group is has minimum paying ratio and using card for just one_off transactions (may be for
utility bills only). This group must be targeted. May be encouraging them by giving no documents
credit card loan in a click away and thereby increasing chance of monthly minimum payment and
thus their credit card score will also increase.
