# CREDIT-CARD-SEGMENTATION

Given problem statement:
This case requires trainees to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy. The
sample dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6
months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

Expectations for building model:

1. Advanced data preparation. Build an ‘enriched’ customer profile by deriving ‘intelligent’ KPI’s such as
monthly average purchase and cash advance amount, purchases by type (one-off, installments), average
amount per purchase and cash advance transaction, limit usage (balance to credit limit ratio), payments
to minimum payments ratio etc.

2. Advanced reporting. Use the derived KPI’s to gain insight on the customer profiles.

3. Clustering. Apply a data reduction technique factor analysis for variable reduction technique and a
clustering algorithm to reveal the behavioral segments of credit card holders.
